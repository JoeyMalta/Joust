## 📜 About the Original Game

> *"Joust"* was released in 1982 by Williams Electronics and became one of the first successful cooperative two-player arcade games. Players control knights riding flying ostriches, flapping to stay airborne while defeating enemy buzzards in a joust-style arena.

This remake is a tribute to the original classic—recreated with love in **Unreal Engine 5**, using **100% Blueprints**, and designed to serve as both a learning tool and a playable retro throwback.
